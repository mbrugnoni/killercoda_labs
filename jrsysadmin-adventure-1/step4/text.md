## Find Bob's work!

Here we go again... Bob just pinged us on Slack. He's wondering if we saw his urgent ticket that he just submitted 2 minutes ago. No Bob, we haven't, but I guess we'll take a look... Hmm, seems that he has lost an important file called "important.doc" and has no idea where it's located. He copied it somewhere the other day but he can't remember where. He thinks he may have typo'd the path as well.

Find the file for him and move, or copy it back to his home directory. Make sure to copy it directly into ~/bblursky.</b>.

The 'find' command would be very helpful for this.
