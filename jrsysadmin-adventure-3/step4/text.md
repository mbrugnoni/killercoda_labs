## Security actions

Right before you were about to shutdown for the day, you see a ticket come in from Bob Blursky's manager. He said there's been numerous reports of Bob's work impacting other developer's and he needs you to lock Bob's account on the server for the time being. Hah! It's about time... His username is `bblursky` (as if we haven't been haunted by it enough that we'd ever forget).

Lock Bob's user ID so he can't impact other development on the server.
