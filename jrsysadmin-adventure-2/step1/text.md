## The server is slow

We just got multiple tickets stating that our new development server is running slow. One of the tickets mention that our old friend Bob Blursky said he was "breaking in the new server" while he went to lunch... We're not really sure what that means, considering this is a VM... 

Take a look at the server and see if there's something chewing up all our CPU. When you find what it is, kill it and move on to your next task. We got more important things to worry about here!

The `top` command would be useful here. Notice something utilizing a lot of CPU?
