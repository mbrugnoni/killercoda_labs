## Generate SSH key

Just when we thought our day was over, one last ticket pops up in our queue. What a coincidence, it's from Bob Blursky. He says he needs to generate an SSH key for his user ID, but doesn't remember how. Let's just do it for him this time so we can go home for the day.

Generate an SSH key for Bob (his username is `bblursky`). It should be a default rsa key with an empty passphrase.</b>.
