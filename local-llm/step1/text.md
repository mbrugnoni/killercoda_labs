## Installing Ollama

First, we're going to install Ollama to run our model. Ollama is an open source platform to run LLMs that is very beginner friendly. We'll be able to get a model up and running in a matter of minutes. 

Install Ollama using the following command:
`curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`{{execute}}

That's all we'll need for this lab. Keep in mind, you can also run Ollama via Docker.
