## Something is wrong with the server

A high priority ticket just came in from... oh no... Bob Blursky...

He says there's something wrong with the server. All of his commands are broken and not working. He can't even list the files in his home directory. Everything was working fine last time he was logged in (of course it was.) He insists that we must have patched the server and broke something and is asking us how long it will take to roll back... Let's see what this guy is talking about...

Find out what's causing Bob Blursky problems and fix the issue. His username is `bblursky`.

Think about which files are run upon a user logging in. Is there anything wrong in there?
