## User using too much storage

Our friend Bob Blursky is at it again. He keeps getting alert emails that he's using too much storage in his home directory. He's not sure what's using so much space as he isn't really working on much... go figure... He opened a ticket to ask us for help removing any excessively large files from his home directory. His usage is supposed to be 1GB, so any files larger than 1GB should be immediately removed.

Try using the `du` command to look for large files.
