## Installing software

Bob Blursky just pinged us on Slack. He's writing a new script and really needs `cowsay` installed on the server... what the heck... You've already told him that it shouldn't be installed on production servers but he escalated to his manager saying you were delaying his project. His manager then pinged your manager, who then pinged you, to tell you to "just install it". The security team rubberstamped his exception request he submitted for installing frivolous sotware.

Install `cowsay` on the server so we can go ahead and move onto something more important.

This distro uses `apt` for its package manager. That could be useful for installing things.
